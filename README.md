# Obfuscated Script for Roblox

## Overview

This is a LUA Script intended to use for KSV4, a Sword Killstreak game from Roblox. This project also features a modified version of **OrionLib** designed specifically for mobile platforms. Key enhancements of the Gui include:

- **Draggable Main Window**: Users can easily move the main window on mobile devices.
- **Draggable Icon**: A dedicated icon allows users to unhide the main window and UI.
- **Close Button Focus**: The minimize button has been disabled, encouraging the use of the close button to hide the main window and UI.

## Compatibility

The GUI has been tested successfully on **Fluxus** and **Delta**. However, it has not been tested on other executors yet. While compatibility checks were performed with **ArceusX** and **Codex Mobile**, these platforms currently do not support OrionLib, resulting in unresponsive GUI interactions.

Head over to the release page for the detailed information and features regarding the KSV4 Script.
